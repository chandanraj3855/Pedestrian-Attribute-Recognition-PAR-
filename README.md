Methodology for Enhancing Person Attribute Recognition (PAR)
The methodology for enhancing Person Attribute Recognition (PAR) in city surveillance, particularly focusing on Indian attire, involves several key steps that leverage advanced deep learning techniques. The approach is structured as follows:
State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Models
Model Selection:
The first step involves evaluating various deep learning architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet. These models are assessed for their effectiveness in recognizing attributes relevant to Indian attire.
Training Process
Transfer Learning:
The methodology employs transfer learning, which allows the use of pre-trained weights from robust models. This is crucial as it helps in leveraging previously learned features that can be beneficial for the new task of attribute recognition.
Fine-Tuning:
After initializing the models with pre-trained weights, fine-tuning is performed on the newly developed dataset that includes diverse examples of Indian clothing styles. This step is essential to adapt the model's parameters to the specific characteristics of the dataset.
Attribute Prediction
Multi-Label Classification Framework:
A multi-label classification approach is implemented to predict multiple attributes simultaneously. This is particularly useful in scenarios where an individual may exhibit several attributes at once (e.g., gender, clothing style, and carried items).
Optimization Techniques
Hyperparameter Tuning:
To achieve optimal performance, hyperparameter tuning is conducted. This involves systematically adjusting parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.
Model Architecture Customization
The base model used in this approach is ResNet-50. Key customizations include:
Modifying the fully connected layer to adapt to the number of classes relevant to Indian attire.
Adding non-linear activation functions (e.g., ReLU) and dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
Utilizing a sigmoid activation function at the output layer to convert raw outputs into probabilities suitable for multi-label classification.
Experimental Results
The methodology has demonstrated significant improvements in recognizing attributes related to Indian attire when compared to baseline models. Notable performance metrics include:
Validation Accuracy: 90.72%
Precision: 92.59%
Recall: 91.81%
F1 Score: 95.20%
These metrics indicate that the proposed approach effectively enhances attribute detection capabilities over traditional methods.
Conclusion and Future Directions
The successful introduction of a comprehensive dataset tailored to Indian attire and the improvements in recognition accuracy highlight the relevance of this methodology for urban surveillance applications in India. Future work will focus on:
Integrating the developed model into live surveillance systems for real-time testing.
Conducting cross-dataset evaluations to assess generalization capabilities.
Expanding the range of recognized attributes to include more detailed aspects of Indian clothing styles.
